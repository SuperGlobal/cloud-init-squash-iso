Used on a Debian 11 (bullseye) virtual machine. Should theoretically run out of the box any linux system that uses apt and has the required packages (mmdebstrap, xorriso, syslinux, isolinux, live-boot).

Run ./build.sh from within the project directory, this script is untested running as a normal user.
